            American Hockey League and the Newfoundland Growlers of the ECHL.

        <p>
            - Mats Sundin was drafted 1st overall in the 1989 by the then Quebec Nordiques and then traded<br>
            to the Maple Leafs in the 1994, where he played the majority of his career, also serving 11<br>
            seasons at their captain! A dynamic playmaker using his skill and size to help him be a prolific<br>
            player in his career, Mats accumulated atleast 70 points in every season of his career. Although<br>
            he never won a cup with the Leafs, he will always have a lasting impression with the franchise.
